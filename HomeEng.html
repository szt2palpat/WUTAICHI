                    <p><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">There are two kind of the Tai Chi practitioners nowadays. The majority of them practice a style of Tai Chi only for the health conserving effect of it, but there an increasing number of them who learning Tai Chi as a martial art. In the Tai Chi Chuan the Daojin (The concentrated usage of the inner energy), the Tuina (Deep breathing exercises), Jingluo (Meridian theory) and the arcing and spiraling movements are united. We who practicing Tai Chi are try to circulate our inner energy (Chi) in the meridians through our movements, and to fill up our energy reservoirs. When our body stores enough energy it can be collected and focused into a punch or a kick we can multiply it’s effect. The arcing and spiraling movements help to divert the possible attacks to the sides and to make it easier to attack the center of the gravity pushing or pulling or to neutralize the opponent in other ways. To perfect the techniques we use the so called sticking and pushing hand exercises. The specialty of them is that while practicing we can polish our skin reflex and how to divert the force of the attacker. Of course complete physical and mental relaxation is needed when practicing to get these results.</span></div>

                    <p>The ones only learning Tai Chi to improve health can benefit from these exercises too, because when practicing the body is moving thoroughly and everyone can benefit from it regardless of sex and age. The Japanese master Kanazawa (9. Dan Shotokan Karate) phrased the positive effect of the Tai Chi in an interview as:</p>
                <p>“- As a Japanese Karate master why do you practice Tai Chi for 30 years?
                    - Because Karate can strengthen your bones and muscles, but the joints and ligaments can only be strengthened by Tai Chi.”</p>
                <p>The Tai Chi was created to mirror the nature in it’s movements and system. So as the high tide follows the low tide, the night follows the day so in the Tai Chi we defend with a roll back movement and attack with a forward movement. If you practice this movements slowly they will encumber and strengthen the joints gradually. Naturally – if we practice slowly – our state of minde will change, that’s why Tai Chi is called moving meditation.</p>

        <h2 id="reg" class="cim">(Health preservation end regeneration)

        </h2>
        <div class="row align-items-start">
            <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12">
               <p>The health preservative and regenerative properties of the Tai Chi are legendary. There are many proven story known widely, like the story of Yang Lu-Chan who is a recognized Tai Chi master.</p>
               <p>Yang Lu-Chan had a sickly childhood and it hasn’t changed even when he became a young adult, more likely his state deteriorated by then. Among others he suffered of pulmonary disease, which has been endemic in China, and he has shown the early symptoms of scorbut because of the improper nutrition. One of his friends has brought Chen Changxing to his attention, who was a well known Tai Chi Chuan master. Yang began to learn from him and in a few years his symptoms disappeared and he felt completely healthy.</p>
                <p>When however he stopped practicing, after a year he coughed blood again, and only the restart of the practice helped his condition.</p>
                <p><strong>“That’s when I understood that my life purpose (karma) is to practice Tai Chi Chuan adt to theach it to others.” he once said.</strong></p>
                <p>From that time on Yang Luchan practiced all trough his life, and lived in a great health. He died in 1872, 73 years old which was quite a beautiful age considering the life expectancy of an average Chinese people of that time.</p>
                <h2> How is the Tai Chi affecting us?</h2>
                <p>The Tai Chi is a complex method, which can be thought as a breathing therapy partially. The eastern breathing methods involve the conscious stimulation and relaxation of the neural-fibers and the muscles and the mind controlled breathing. The significance of this is, when the mind and a body is balanced it will be more resistant to the diseases, or rather if the person is already ill, the mental strength helps to heal. While practicing Tai Chi we not only exercise the body, we balancing our mind too, and we learn to evaluate the things which are happening to and around us more exactly and not to under or overrate them.</p>
                <h2>Breathing</h2>
                <p>If we observe the connection between our breathing and our momentary state of mind we can see they are connected continually. If we watching an infant we can see before he began to cry his breathing frequency will rise, but when he well fed and content his breathing is calm and even. People who just become parents for the first time sometimes worried that their babies not breathing continuously. Of course most of the time this is just the surface.</p>
                <p>Our stat of mind is effecting our breathing too naturally. Just think about the instinctive habit when in a pressing situation – for example before an exam – we take deep breaths to calm and collect ourselves. This is an instinctive reaction which is used by those whom practicing Tai Chi continually. At first the proper breathing must be monitored, later it will become fully automatic. If we breathing slowly, deeply and even, then our system will get enough oxygen and this will benefit our mind greatly.</p>
                <p>Other significant property of the Tai Chi breathing that when practiced in the correct way it massage the internal organs, helping them to function perfectly. This is one of the reasons why practicing Tai Chi can improve the health of patients suffering from heart-, stomach-, digestion- diseases or diabetes and high blood pressure.</p>

                <h2>Circulation</h2>


                <p>In the human body we can differentiate between three circulation. First is the blood which circulate in the blood vessels, the lymph circulation in the lymph nodes and the energy (Chi) circulation in the energy lines (meridians).</p>
                <p>One of the fundamental things in the Tai Chi that the practitioner continuously moving his or her center of gravity from one leg to the other, periodically tensing and relaxing the muscles in the legs, pumping the blood and the lymph in the vessels and lymph nodes. The vessels are working like little hears, when the muscles relax they replete with blood, when they got compressed my the tensing muscles they push the blood forward. This periodical pressure change helps to keep the vessels clean and relives the heart while keeping their flexibility.</p>

            </div>






            <div  class=" col-lg-6 col-sm-12">


                <p>While practicing Tai Chi we transforming the energy inside, we assimilate energy form our surrounding, we speed the circulation up and harmonize the Yin and Yang energies. With this we take down the energy blocks in our system and revitalize the parts which are lacking energy.</p>
                <h2>Joints</h2>

                <p>While practicing Tai Chi we almost constantly changing the strain on our legs and our joints. Because it’s happening slowly and gradually, the joints will strengthen considerably over time and helps the secretion of the joint fluid. This helps to prevent and treat injuries and joint diseases.</p>
                <p>Because the essence of the Tai Chi are the effortless movements, it is relaxing the whole body, the spine helping to prevent and treat wide scale of spine problems.</p>
                <h2>Mind and state of mind</h2>

               <p>Practicing Tai Chi demands high degree of concentration and because of this have a positive effect on the central nervous system. These days when stress takes an everyday part in our life causing a great number of diseases (high blood pressure, heart attack, etc.), acquiring Tai Chi can give an important help to fight and neutralize stress. While practicing we train the mind and the body simultaneously, and these exercises will stimulate some regions of the cerebral cortex and will inhibit others, helping the brain to relax and sooth the tension created by sicknesses and improving conditions based on stress. The body reacts to our frame of mind, but it works backward too, if we are edgy and tense our body will be same our muscles will cramp up, but if we learn to relax our body then our accumulated tension will decrease.</p>
                <h2>So which are the sicknesses when the Tai Chi help?</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Heart and circulation diseases</li>
                    <li>Diabetes</li>
                    <li>Stomach and other digestive organ’s problems</li>
                    <li>Respiratory conditions</li>
                    <li>Joint diseases</li>
                    <li>Gynecological problems</li>
                    <li>Stress and physical and mental conditions caused by stress</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>This enumeration is not complete because the effect of the Tai Chi is still researched in China and other parts of the word. The effects are real in more and more country – in Hungary too – Tai Chi is used in hospitals to complement the Western medicine. In China and other far eastern countries there are hospitals which are using only Tai Chi, Chi Kung, and breathing exercises to heal.</p>

            <h2>The proper posture</h2>



            <h4>The elements of correct posture are as follows:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The position of the ridge and the opening of the three gates.</li>
                <li>Activate Bai Huy, Yung Chuan, and Hui Yin points.</li>
                <li> Rooting.</li>
                <li>Relaxation, but not slackness</li>
            </ul>










            <p>One of my students, whom I was trying to get to do the exercises with a straight back and the right posture, burst out.

                - Understand sifu, if I pull myself out, the energy does not go as well as with a "loose" hold.

                After much persuasion, he was willing to practice in the right posture, and after a few weeks he told me that there was indeed much more energy flowing in his body than before

                If our spine is not aligned in the right way,  then we have no roots, Chi does not flow properly in our body, and we cannot channel the opponent's strength into the ground, but fall.</p>

            <h3>Let's see what this looks like in practice</h3>



            <h4>Connecting celestial and terrestrial Chí fields:</h4>

            <p>We begin to form, stand in a loose upright posture. The Hui Yin point on the perineum muscle is pushed downwards towards the ground, while the Bai Hui point on the top of the head is pushed towards the sky. With this, we connect the earthly and celestial Chi, that is, we begin to attract them into our bodies.</p>



            <h4> Opening of the three gates:</h4>

            <p>Ahhoz, hogy a kis égi körön (befogadó és kormányzó meridián) az energia szabadon áramoljon, ki kell nyitni a három kaput. Ehhez, a farokcsontunkat kissé billentsük befelé, míg a keresztcsontot toljuk hátra. Ezzel a mozdulattal megnyitottuk a Ming Men pont magasságában lévő kaput. A két lapocka közti kapu kinyitásához lazán engedjük előre a vállainkat, hogy a hát enyhén domború, a mellkas pedig enyhén homorú legyen. A harmadik, a jáde párnán lévő kapu kinyitásához az állat kissé ejtsük le, és húzzuk be a nyak felé, miközben a fejtetőn lévő Bai Huy pontot nyomjuk az ég felé.</p>



            <h4>Rooting:</h4>

            <p>During rooting, the use of the mind is especially necessary. Rooting takes place through three points of the sole. We need to create a sensation as if we nail our foot to the ground through the toe pad under the big toe, through the pad under the little toe and through the center of the heel. In particular, at these three points, we should feel that our soles are pressed against the ground, and at the Yung Chuan point on the soles, a sort of arch is formed, and here we absorb the earthly Chi from the ground, which we then transmit to the rest of the body.

                It is very important to use this posture not only during the basic position, but to maintain it continuously during practice.</p>

            <h2 id="Breath">The proper breathing</h2>

            <div class="row align-items-start">
                <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12">
                    <p> In the east, there are two different kind of method to differentiate breathing. The first method differentiate adominal breathing, thoracic breathing and combined breathing. Basically the usage of the combined breathing is expedient.</p>

                    <h4>Fire and water element, or wisdom and emotion due to the breathing:</h4>
                    <p> Mai rohanó világunkban, mikor egyre többet idegeskedünk, és egyre többet ülünk az íróasztalunk, a futószalag, vagy a TV előtt, esetleg az autóban és a buszon, automatikusan rááll a szervezetünk a mellkasi légzésre. Ez azonban igen káros is lehet. Hogy miért? Nos, ha a felsőtestünket ketté osztjuk egy képzeletbeli vízszintes vonallal kb. a szegycsont magasságában, akkor megkapjuk azt a válaszvonalat, amely alatt a víz elem uralkodik, s amely a bölcsességért, a megfontolt viselkedésért, gondolkodásért, életért felelős. A képzeletbeli vonal felett pedig a tűz elem uralkodik, amely az érzelmekért felel. Ha valamelyik elemet meg-, illetve felerősítjük a másik rovására, akkor megbomlik a harmónia, és aszerint, hogy melyik elem erősödött fel, annak megfelelő mentális és fizikai tünetek jelennek meg.

                    <p>In our rushing world, when we experience more and more stress, and sit more and more in front of the desk, production line, or TV, perhaps in a car or bus, our organism automatically switches to thoracic breathing. This occurrence is maybe harmful however. And why? Well, if we separate our torso along a horizontal, imaginary line approximately at the breast-bone, we will get a line, below the water element reings, which is responsible for the wisdom, careful behaviour, thinking, and life. Above this line the fire element reigns, which is responsible for our feelings. If we fortify one of theese to the detriment of the other, the harmony will be come to an end, and according to which element is dominant, the proper mental and physical symptons will be appear.</p>

                    <p>If we prefer thoracic breathing, we will experience emotional eruptions, heart rhythm problems. For example One of our student complained, when he do Chí Kung, his heart beats godspeed. When I asked him to do abdominal breathing, his complain gone.</p>
                    <p>Often occur, that those who suffer from depression use thoracic respiration continously. I do not claim that these peoples can recover from their illness with the alteration of their breathing, buti it is a good beginning on the path of the recovery.</p>


                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12">
                    <p>Rarely, but occur, that someone continously uses abdominal breathing. It is said that theese people are insensitive, selfish, dull. They have no dreams, they cannot be inspirated, and they cannot show their feelings.</p>
                    <p>As I said, the natural and correct is usually the combined breathing. in such a case, we draw in the air entirely into the stomach, paying attention to don't suck the air from the stomach, but from outside. We fill the lung's thoracic part too. When the inhalation has finished, exhalation, first from the chest and the from the stomach. This kind of breathing is better - beyond it's emotional effects - because we inhale much more fresh air and oxygen and we can exhale much more carbon-dioxid. (Itt a pont után is kisbetű van.) So we can load out our organism, and provide better with oxygen for blanced function. And one more thing, why is the proper breathing is important: Everybody experienced already, that the massage - let it be even only a prodding, self massage, or a complete partner massage - has positive effect on the muscular system and on the mood. Actually, all men should have take a full body massage in a fortnight. (A loosening massage with an eastern or western type may be good equally.) At least so important our organs' continuous massage, which we can provide with the correct breathing. </p>

                    <h4>Normal and reverse breathing:</h4>
                    <p>The other method of the differentiation of the breathing, that we examine, that the stomach is what kind of state at the inhalation and at the exhalation. Based on this we differentiate normal, or Buddhist breathing, and reverse, or Taoist breathing.</p>
                        <p>In case of normal breathing at the inhalation, the stomach rises (bulges). in adult age this is the wide-spread, and used breathing method. Actually the human organism switched to this kind of breathing, and it is not problem.</p>
                   <p>The reverse breathing in certain cases just as natural, than the normal breathing. For example after the infant's birth, she uses reverse breathing for app. a 4-6 hours duration and when she cries she often return to this kind of breathing. I must caution everybody against a „hey-presto!" switch to the reverse brathing, for example during practising Tai Chi, or Chí Kung. Because if her body is not ready, she will take a great damage in her energy circulation.</p>
