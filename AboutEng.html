                <p>Dr. Armen Tatevosjan was born in the former Soviet Union, in Armenia. He began to acquaint himself with martial arts at the age of 8, specifically karate. When he met his master, Gao Xin Yan, a new world opened up for him. In the class where he studied, he "graduated" alongside four classmates: Vitalij Sorbiecev, German Popov, and Andres Serednjakov. Initially, they didn't know what they were learning, only that it was a Chinese martial art. After several years of foundation, they noticed that the newly learned techniques and movements were somehow different from the previous ones, much looser and softer. In response to their question of whether they were feeling it correctly, their master replied, yes, these are internal strong techniques.</p>
                <p>Their master, Gau Xin Yan, was a master of several styles (Wu Tai Chi Chuan, Choj Gar, Hsing-I, Pa Kua, Mizong Chuan) and taught them all. During the training, they all learned the basics and Tai Chi Chuan from the master, and then each of them was taught one style. (For example, Armen's master was Hsing-I.) Then, under his supervision, they taught each other the other styles. Thanks to this, they could learn not only kung fu from their master but also teaching.</p>
                <p>Since the Wu-style Tai Chi Chuan founder's family created their own medical method based on Wu Tai Chi Chuan (combining the five elements theory, acupressure, Tai Chi energy, and massage), they also mastered this.</p>
                <p>After obtaining degrees in both Western medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine from medical school, he withdrew to the mountains to practice what he had learned from his master.</p>
                <p>Later, he opened his own school in Yerevan, and when he arrived in Hungary in 1990 to visit a friend, he was so impressed by the Szekszárd hills that he decided to move there as well. He has been living here ever since, teaching Wu Tai Chi, Chi Kung, and Choj Gar style.</p>

                <p>Sifu Zoltán Tóth, the head of the school, has been practicing Tai Chi since 1991.</p>
                <p>Initially, he learned and practiced Wu Tai Chi Wai Tan Chi Kung, which he was introduced to by Chi Kung teacher Zsolt Kis, and then, a few years later, he learned the Beijing 24-form and the Yang style from an instructor of partly Chinese and partly European descent, Siu Lao Tang.</p>
                <p>As he wanted to learn the complete system of Tai Chi, but his teacher could only teach the martial part of Tai Chi, at his suggestion, he approached Dr. Armen Tatevosjan, an internationally renowned master of Wu Tai Chi. After being accepted as his disciple, he began learning the Wu-style 37-step Tai Chi Chuan form and, naturally, the entire associated system from him. Over the past years, he has learned several forms from Master Armen and regularly practiced with various Tai Chi masters during his trips to China, gaining a lot of experience through these practices.</p>
                <p>Since the Wu-style Tai Chi has its own healing method developed by the Wu family (combining the 8 basic energies of Tai Chi, the theory of the five elements, the use of acupressure points, and traditional massage), he learned this from his master as well and now assists his patients primarily with joint problems in his own practice.</p>
                <p>In addition to his work, he leads Wu Tai Chi and LMK Wing Chun training sessions at the central gym in Szeged, as well as numerous courses and seminars, partly in his own schools (see: Education - Schools in the menu), and partly in response to external invitations.</p>
                <p>He regularly serves as a judge at competitions organized by the Hungarian Kung Fu Federation, as well as other domestic and international competitions, as an internal strength (Tai Chi, Hsing-I, Pa-Kua) judge.</p>

        <h2>About the School</h2>
        <h3>Beginnings and Continuation</h3>

        <p>Our school was founded in 1997 as a small group in Szeged. Initially, there were only 7 members in this small community, and we practiced Yang Tai Chi, specifically the 24-step form. During the first practice, our instructor, Zoltán Tóth, mentioned that he was also learning the style from a master in Budapest and only started teaching to have some practice partners. He accepted anyone who decided not to learn from him based on this. However, everyone showed up for the next practice session with great enthusiasm and delved into learning. Though these individuals gradually stopped practicing over the years, it is thanks to them that the first Tai Chi school in Szeged came into existence. The small group - though its reputation spread only by word of mouth - continued to grow steadily. In 1999, when the first posters were put up, the room suddenly became too small for the 50-60 practitioners, so two groups had to be formed, teaching at different times.</p>

        <p>People kept coming. New practitioners discovered Tai Chi and its beneficial effects. Even after many years, we still meet people who once practiced Tai Chi Chuan here, always speaking fondly of the community spirit. Some even return years later to revive their knowledge and equip themselves with new skills.</p>

        <p>In 2001, a significant change occurred in the school. The previously practiced Yang style Tai Chi was replaced by the Wu style. The decision was made because the instructor teaching the Yang style, Master Hsiu Lao Tang, only taught the martial aspect of Tai Chi.</p>

        <p>Zoltán Tóth learned the entire Wu style, including its health-preserving and healing aspects, from Dr. Armen Tatevosjan, an Armenian master.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, due to the change, many who didn't want to "start over" dropped out, but those who stayed didn't regret their decision.</p>

        <p>Although the new style differed from the old one, it provided a very good foundation, as we can read in the Tai Chi history menu, Wu style was created from the Yang style by the style's founder, Chuan You.</p>

        <p>As a disciple of Master Armen, Sifu Zoltán Tóth learned and taught various Chi Kung techniques, which led to the formation of the Szeged Chi Kung group. Our first Tai Chi group was followed by several others across the country because Sifu Zoltán Tóth is willing to teach wherever he is invited and where seminars are organized for him, which can lead to further cooperation. Thus, groups were formed in Gyula, Békéscsaba, Orosháza, Hódmezővásárhely, Győr, Csongrád, and Szentes. In 2002, two young men from Oradea (Romania) contacted him, expressing their desire to learn from him, and since 2005, they have been teaching Wu Tai Chi and Chi Kung in Oradea.</p>

        <p>Today, there is also Chi Kung training within the framework of the school in Rimaszombat, Slovakia, and we plan to start more groups in the future.</p>
